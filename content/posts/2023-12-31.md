# Previous Week Reflection 

## On a scale between 1 (mindless consumer zombie) and 10 (da Vinci of technology), how much have I used technology for my benefit, rather than it using me?

9

Here are some amazing ways technology has served me:
- My brothers and I were able to re-connect, spend quality time together, and reminisce together as we played classic xbox games
- I bought an automatic door closer, which takes me out of the loop of closing the door behind me, thus increasing the probability that I will not re-enter my room, without any extra will power (since this is automated)
- I have bought a dedicated chromebook just for monitoring, and a HDMI adapter for the chromebook, which allows me to always have my calendar at a glance, from which I can make quick decisions based on what I have planned. Moreover, on another monitor, I have written down my work obligations, so that I am visually reminded of my tasks, thereby increasing the probability I will finish them in time

Here are where I can improve:
- I still slacked on Bumble, using the holidays as an excuse. But I could have used that time to connect with my family, rather than fool myself with the idea of finding a connection online

## On a scale between 1 (rock-bottom depressed) and 10 (jubilant joy), and 7 not existing, Am I happy doing what I'm doing now?

There is some seasonal effect on this score (from the holidays), but here's the breakdown.

Pros:
- I built a fully-functional, PHP/HTML/CSS database-type script. The more I practice this, the better I will get of crafting up a website, which will make it so much easier for me to freely give to people
- I spent some pretty good/okay time with family: dinner, church, xbox, tennis, bars
- I met with two of my friends through fitness: one with a run at flatwoods, another with a gym session
- I played chess with my dad
- I was able to give a gift to my siblings

Cons:
- I found myself doing monotonous things at work today, basic data pulls that felt so manual where I needed to be actively engaged for several hours. I tried web-scraping the data to automate, but I fell short on my skills. I will practice for the next opportunity
- I lost a game of chess to my dad 

## This past week, what have I done to build the life I want?

I spent time with family, knowing I won't regret the time I had with them

## This past week, whose opinions steered my course?

Max. He inspires me to earn more money and be a better person.

Also, somethime this month, but not this week, I was captivated by [MLK's speech on "Your Life's Blue Print"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmtOGXreTOU)

Here are the main points from MLK's speech:
1. Have a deep belief in your own dignity, worth, and your own "somebody"-ness
2. The *basic* **principle** to achieve **excellence** in your various fields of endeavors
    - Don't settle for good; be the best!
    - Be so good, people will clear paths just to see you
3. A commitment to the **eternal principles** of: 
    - beauty
    - love
    - justice

Another person is Leila Hormozi's advice on trusting people. Naturally, as you scale and delegate, you will get to trust more people. The question you must ask yourself are: (1) Has this person done anything in their past that hinders my trust for them? (2) Has this person ever wronged me? (3) If not, what things am I holding from *my own* past that prevents me from trusting people?

Then there is the YouTube Channel ["hoe_math"](https://www.youtube.com/@hoe_math), who said at one point (I am going to paraphrase): "I think we would think twice about our choices if we thought about what would happen 1 or 2 months after we took action".

Additionally, [Bryan Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson) uploaded a video titled, ["My Ex-FiancÃ©e Sued Me For $9,000,000"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5rokANviwo). It was surprising how a man who lived such a healthy, loving, holy relationship had his former life partner turn completely 180 degrees to an enemy--FOR NO REAL REASON other than to get money from Bryan. It was a harsh wake-up call. She has **ZER0** evidence of Bryan's wrong-doing. Bryan could have become "time efficient" and just paid the woman to "pick his battles"--but HE DIDN'T! Why? Because it was a matter of **PRINCIPLE**! He spent 2 years defending himself, after which he was found innocent. Bryan **knew for a fact** he did nothing wrong, and he stuck to his guns and prevailed in the face of justice.

> "**It would have been so easy** to relent and *quietly* make them go away. **That's what nearly everyone does**. But I am NOT guilty, and they have me no choice but to spend **two years** litigating to defend my innocence. Giving in and paying up would have been an injustice to me and an injustice to society, enabling this twisted practice" (7:45-8:13)

> "[Their] strategy was to inflict maximum pain and suffering on me so that I would pay-up privately. They *miscalculated* my **tenaciousness** and **resolve** and their strategy backfired, inflicting collateral **damage upon themselves**." (9:28-9:46)

This is what I like about Bryan. He is a living example of power versus force. His attackers use force, which ends up hurting themselves. Bryan did not attack; he stood firm on his principles.

> "My accuser has been astonishingly pernicious, nonetheless **I choose**, again, **to support her** as she works through her health and well-being. The settlement funds she owes me will be routed to a trust I established for her medical needs. She is the soul beneficiary and is the only person who can access the trust.**I won't keep a penny** of what she pays as part of the judgement" (9:58-10:30)

WOW. Even after Bryan had to defend himself for 2 years and sacrfacing time and attention to this case, in the end, he is **choosing** to not accept any money from his ex-wife, and instead that money is actually going to **help** the very person who was attacking him. This is a living example of what a loving person is. I am speechless! This is like an avatar move--he was attacked, and now we could *rightfully* receive compensation for the damage she did, yet, he is using that money to help his attacker get better! WHAT!! If it were any other person, people would call this person a "beta male"--but he is NOT a beta male in this case, he is a loving person! That is insane!

> "I know many of you may be thinking that this situation is something that happens to other people and something that won't happen to you. The things [reviled] here is that every minute of every day, each of us invest ourselves into building our **reputations**...our reputation is our **life currency**." (10:30-11:30)

## This past week, how often did I do things I actively enjoyed? How does this compare to the prior week?

Quite often, this was a great week.

## This past week, what am I doing right now because I think I *SHOULD* do it?

Working. I felt so alone, so I worked for a bit, and then at night, I went to go visit my family.

## This past week, how did I give away 10% of my income?

I did not...yet?

## This past week, what reoccurring questions did I have? Why did I have each question? How can I use my curiosity to explore these questions?



## From Jordan Peterson: Sit on your bed one day, and as yourself, "what remarkably stupid things am I doing on a regular basis to absolutely screw up my life?"

## What small. cheap, dopamine am I settling for? what's teh better alternative that I *could* be developing instead?

## Did you know you can teleport? Change your mindset and watch your environment change, what identities are you still clinging to that's time to let go of?

## Looking at my goals form last week, did I achieve ALL of last week's goals? (yes or no)

## What prevented me from achieving the goals I told myself that I would do?

## What have been my biggest time wasters from last week? What could I be doing instead, to achieve the same goal, and more?

## What have I done to build the life I want?

## 	This past week, what fears did I non-judgementally notice? What's my plan to confront these fears, knowing that it leads to gold?

## What are the mundane, tedious, time-consuming taks that are pulling my attention away from what really matters?

## For which of these tasks does the *completion* matter more than the *quality*?

## How much would it cost for me to hire-out or automate these tasks? Both in what I lose in quality, what I lose in resources, but also in what I gain in life. Careful: make sure I'm not replacing tasks that are actually theraputic in nature or increase my perspective on life (e.g. going to a public gym to hedge against social anxiety; church meetings to hear about what other people are going through compared to my meager issues, etc.)

## Answer this question: knowing my hourly rate, and the fact that TIME is my greatest resource, how can I buy-back time to earn more in money and time?

## Looking at my schedule, am I preparing the future me (30s, 40s, 50s) to be prepared to handle the chaos of managing an intimate relationship, the upbringing of children, and the responsibility to handle the waves of chaos that will challenge my health, family, community, and society?
