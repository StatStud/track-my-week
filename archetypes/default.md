## General

### Highlight of the week

### How old am I today?

### How long has it been since I graduated university?

### Am I were I wished older me would be by now? 

### On a scale between 1 (mindless consumer zombie) and 10 (da Vinci of technology), excluding 7, how much have I used technology for my benefit, rather than it using me?

### What is my total screen time? What is the screen time distribution?

### On a scale between 1 (rock-bottom depressed) and 10 (jubilant joy), and 7 not existing, Am I happy doing what I'm doing now?

### This past week, what have I done to build the life I want?

### This past week, whose opinions steered my course?

### This past week, how often did I do things I actively enjoyed? How does this compare to the prior week?

### This past week, what am I doing right now because I think I *SHOULD* do it?

### This past week, how did I give away 10% of my income?

### This past week, what reoccurring questions did I have? Why did I have each question? How can I use my curiosity to explore these questions?

### From Jordan Peterson: Sit on your bed one day, and as yourself, "what remarkably stupid things am I doing on a regular basis to absolutely screw up my life?"

### What small. cheap, dopamine am I settling for? what's the better alternative that I *could* be developing instead?

### Did you know you can teleport? Change your mindset and watch your environment change, what identities are you still clinging to that's time to let go of?

What really matters is...

The small things that take my attention away are...

### For which of these tasks above does the *completion* matter more than the *quality*?

### How much would it cost for me to hire-out or automate these tasks? Both in what I lose in quality, what I lose in resources, but also in what I gain in life. Careful: make sure I'm not replacing tasks that are actually therapeutic in nature or increase my perspective on life (e.g. going to a public gym to hedge against social anxiety; church meetings to hear about what other people are going through compared to my meager issues, etc.)

### Answer this question: knowing my hourly rate, and the fact that TIME is my greatest resource, how can I buy-back time to earn more in money and time?

### Looking at my schedule, am I preparing the future me (30s, 40s, 50s) to be prepared to handle the chaos of managing an intimate relationship, the upbringing of children, and the responsibility to handle the waves of chaos that will challenge my health, family, community, and society?

# A final note to myself

Review your essential questions above (at the very beginning of this document).
Are your actions in alignment with where you want to go?

Look at your environment and ask yourself "what kind of person would this environment create?"

If you don't like the answer, change your environment or lose your dream.
